Hands-on Tutorial for 3DCityDB Beginners
==================================
This tutorial gives a step-by-step instructions about the download and installation of the software, the import of CityGML datasets, the export and 3D visualization of 3D city models in a web browser. Please note that this tutorial does not provide an extensive explanation of the 3DCityDB sofware package itself. If you need more details about 3DCityDB, please refer to the [comprehensive technical documentation](https://github.com/3dcitydb/3dcitydb/tree/master/Documentation) instead.

More information
----------------
[OGC CityGML](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/citygml) is an open data model and XML-based format for the storage and exchange of semantic 3D city models. It is an application schema for the [Geography Markup Language version 3.1.1 (GML3)](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/gml), the extendible international standard for spatial data exchange issued by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and the ISO TC211. The aim of the development of CityGML is to reach a common definition of the basic entities, attributes, and relations of a 3D city model.

CityGML is an international OGC standard and can be used free of charge.
